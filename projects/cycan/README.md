# [Cycan Network](https://cycan.network/)

## Project Introduction

Cycan, short for Cyber Canaan, is a bountiful land in the crypto world.
The Cycan network (CYN) is a cross-chain, decentralized asset management platform. It is a parachain based on the Polkadot network. Its canary chain, Everlasting parachain (ELP), is a parachain based on Kusama. Its mission is to become a leading decentralized asset management platform based on WASM. The protocol allows everyone to initiate, manage and invest in decentralized funds on the chain freely, safely and efficiently.
Cycan has also developed a stablecoin with anti-inflation characteristics that adopts "reserve + algorithm‚Äù duality, namely Everlasting Cash (ELC). In the future, Cycan will cooperate with other parachains to quickly achieve DeFi "Lego" collaboration through the XCMP protocol. Cycan will also use heterogeneous cross-chain bridges to achieve cross-chain decentralized crypto asset management services with blockchain networks including ETH, BSC, and SOL.

## Wasm contract technical support

The Cycan team has successfuly submitted an application for our ELC (Everlasting Cash) project to the Polkadot Web3 Foundation for Open Grants Program and delivered milestone one.
The ELC project used Cargo to compile, generate WASM code and has been deployed to the Phoenix blockchain through the Redspot script. It has successfully run on the Phoenix chain.

Cycan is developing a VM intermodulation system between WASM and EVM, and is also developing the decentralized asset management and other related DeFi protocols based on WASM.

## Developer activity

Coming soon.
