## Project Introduction

NFTMart is developed based on Substrate, the first decentralized NFT transaction public chain in the world. It is committed to providing professional, low gas with NFT issuance, transaction, investment and other services for users.

The platform is divided into two parts: The first part is NFTMart.network, an open decentralized NFT public chain, which is mainly used to release NFT assets and process transaction data on the chain. The second part is the entrance to the NFTMart.io platform, to provide users with convenient and fast transaction services and itâ€™s convenient for users to upload or manage NFT works.

Through the establishment of NFTMART's Ecological Fund, NFTMart will support third parties to expand NFTMart through RPC, smart contracts and other methods to achieve a more diversified  NFT+ ecosystem.
